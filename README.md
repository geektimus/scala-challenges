# Scala Challenges

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geektimus/scala-challenges.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geektimus/scala-challenges)

This repo will contain the solutions using Scala for challenges found on:

* Books
* Hacker Rank
* Codility
* CodeFights

## Challenges
### Hacker Rank
#### Super Reduced String

Write a function to reduce a given string to its shortest length by doing a series of 
operations in which we select a pair of adjacent lowercase letters that match, 
and then we delete them.

### Codility
#### Missing Integer
Find smallest positive integer that is NOT in the given array:

Example: 
```
for [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2] the missing integer is [5]
for [4, 1, 5, 6, 2] the missing integer is [3]
```

#### Frog Jumps
We need to find the minimum number of jumps a small frog can make from a starting position X to a ending position Y 
given a jump distance D

### Others (Challenges proposed by Friends or Solved on hackatons)
#### Recursively reverse a string
Given a string, reverse the characters and return.

Example:
```
for "Test" it should return "tseT"
for "Return" it should return "nruteR"
```
